# Switch Corresponding
 `switch-corresponding` allows you to easily switch between interface and implementation files (.h/.cpp or .m etc) with one command

Bind your favourite key combination to this command: `extension.switch_corresponding` and `extension.switch_corresponding_same_dir` (to limit switch search to the same directory)

(I  like `Alt+O` from Visual Assist in Visual Studio :))

** NOTE: ** You must create a project for this to work.
The easiest way to do this is to `cd` to the directory you want as your root from terminal/command line, and then type `'code .'`.
That will create a project with your current location as the workspace root and `switch-corresponding` will work as expected!
Also if you haven't done this already, you may need to install `code` to your system PATH.
If you hit F1, and start typing install, you should see an option for `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` - hit that and you're away!

**Enjoy!**
