# Switch Corresponding
 `switch-corresponding` allows you to easily switch between interface and implementation files (.h/.cpp or .m etc) with one command

Bind your favourite key combination to this command: `extension.switch_corresponding`

(I  like `Alt+O` from Visual Assist in Visual Studio :))

**Enjoy!**
